# use for loops to do a run a set of code multiple times in a row

# example of using a for loop
# item will be each character in the string after one another. Here is some code to show that
for item in 'python':
    print('item: ', item)

# You can define a list with square brackets
# You can use these list in for loops

for item2 in ['Lucas', 'Mehtab', 'Josh']:
    print('item2: ', item2)

# you can use the range function to write an range of number
for item3 in range(10):
    print('item3: ', item3)

# also you can specify the start and end number.
for item4 in range(5, 10):
    print('item4: ', item4)

# also you can add a step/number to increment by
for item5 in range(5, 10, 2):
    print('item5: ', item5)
