# how to use a nested loop to create some coordinates
for x in range(4):
    for y in range(3):  # this is the inner loop
        print(f'({x},{y})')

# CHALLENGE
# make a nested loop that displays and f like this:
# xxxxx
# xx
# xxxxx
# xx
# xx
# the first line should look like this
numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
