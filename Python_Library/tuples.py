# Tuples are like lists but they cannot be modified
# to make some tuples you use brackets instead of square brackets
# You can only get infromation about a tuple.

# You can find what a item is in a tuple by putting an index after the tuple name
nums = (1, 2, 3)
print(nums[1])

# if you try to change an item in a tuple then you will get an error
# they are very rarely used over lists but you can use them for when you want to make sure that you do not change the data
